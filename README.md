# Harshan Ashwad – Portfolio

A fully customized and production-grade developer portfolio built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**, designed to showcase my work, skillset, and certifications in AI/ML, Data Science, and Software Engineering.

Originally bootstrapped from a lightweight starter template, I have heavily restructured it with:

- ⚙️ Advanced animations using **Framer Motion**
- 🎨 Dynamic theming, hover interactions, and card flipping logic
- 📬 Integrated **EmailJS** for in-browser message delivery without leaving the site
- 🧠 Modular skill display mapped to real-world proficiencies across **ML frameworks**, **data analysis**, **backend**, and **frontend** stacks
- 🌐 Deployed with **Firebase Hosting**, supporting fully responsive design

This is not just a static site—it's a technically expressive, component-driven project reflecting both engineering depth and design sensibility.
